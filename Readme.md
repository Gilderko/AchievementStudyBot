# Discord Study Bot 

This is a repository for the Discord study bot I created for educational purposes of the PV178 course, 
which takes place at the Faculty of Informatics at Masaryk University.

The main goal of the Discord bot is for students to request achievements and for teacher to be capable
of acknowledging these achievements using a Discord server.

Functionality:
- Administrator of the bot is capable of registering new teachers 
- Students can register using special commands
- Teachers can select which students they teach
- Students can request an achievement to be granted by a teacher
- Granting an achievement awards points which may increase a rank of the student
